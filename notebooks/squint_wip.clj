;; #### ðŸ§™ Evaluator

;; By default, [SCI](https://github.com/babashka/sci) is used for evaluating `:render-fn` functions in the browser.

;; What follows is an intentionally inefficient but fun way to compute
;; the nth fibonacci number and show how long it took.

;; You can opt into [cherry](https://github.com/squint-cljs/cherry) as an
;; alternative evaluator by setting `{::clerk/render-evaluator :cherry}` via the
;; viewers opts (see [Customizations](#customizations)). The main difference between cherry and SCI
;; for viewer functions is performance. For performance-sensitive code cherry is
;; better suited since it compiles directly to JavaScript code.
